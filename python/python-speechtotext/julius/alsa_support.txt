The command:
 "adinrec -input asla test.wav"

results in:
 ERROR: m_options: "-input alsa": ALSA support is not built-in
 Error reading arguments

This will be fixed if libasound2-dev is added as a build dependency.

For example, julius can be rebuilt in the following way, and adinrec will have alsa support:

sudo apt-get build-dep julius
 sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev
 apt-get source julius
 cd julius-4.1.5
